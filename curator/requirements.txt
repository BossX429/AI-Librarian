# No additional dependencies needed!
# The curator uses only Python standard library:
# - json (for parsing JSONL)
# - sqlite3 (for database storage)
# - pathlib (for file operations)
# - re (for regex pattern matching)
# - datetime (for timestamps)
# - hashlib (for content hashing)
# - typing (for type hints)

# All of these come with Python 3.7+ by default
