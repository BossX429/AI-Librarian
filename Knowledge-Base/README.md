## Status: Post-Reformat (2025-11-25)



System was reformatted today. Knowledge base structure created.



Most documentation is template-based and needs population with actual data.

1. Install Python and development tools



2. Rebuild AI-Librarian core functionality



3. Document actual configurations



4. Populate software inventory



5. Restore project files if backups exist
