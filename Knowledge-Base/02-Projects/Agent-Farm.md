# Agent-Farm Project

## Overview
**Status:** Lost in reformat - needs rebuild  
**Purpose:** AI agent evolution framework treating agents as biological organisms  
**Approach:** Evolutionary mechanics applied to AI agent development

## Concept
- Agents treated as biological organisms
- Evolution-based development methodology
- Natural selection principles for agent optimization
- Fitness functions for agent performance

## Architecture
- Agent lifecycle management
- Fitness evaluation system
- Mutation and crossover mechanisms
- Selection pressure algorithms
- Population management

## Goals
- Autonomous agent improvement
- Self-optimizing AI systems
- Emergent behavior discovery
- Performance evolution without manual tuning

## Setup Status
- [ ] Framework architecture designed
- [ ] Agent base classes implemented
- [ ] Evolution engine developed
- [ ] Fitness evaluation system built
- [ ] Testing infrastructure created

## Notes
- Previous work lost in reformat
- Core concepts to preserve: biological metaphor, autonomous evolution
- Focus on local GPU utilization for agent computation
