# 🚀 AI Librarian - Installation Guide

## ⚡ Autonomous Mode (Recommended - 30 Seconds Setup!)

**This is the "set it and forget it" mode. Do this once and never think about it again.**

### Step 1: Install (ONE TIME ONLY)

1. Open Windows Explorer
2. Navigate to: `C:\Projects\AI-Librarian\orchestrator\`
3. **Right-click** `install_autonomous.bat`
4. Select **"Run as Administrator"**
5. Wait 10 seconds
6. Done!

### What Just Happened?

The installer just:
- ✅ Created a Windows Task Scheduler task
- ✅ Set it to auto-start on every Windows login
- ✅ Started the AI Librarian in background RIGHT NOW
- ✅ Configured 24/7 autonomous operation

### What Happens Now? (Forever!)

**Automatically, with ZERO work from you:**

1. **Every second:** Captures Claude conversations
2. **Every 5 minutes:** Compresses logs (85% smaller!)
3. **After compression:** Updates searchable database
4. **On crashes:** Restarts itself automatically
5. **On Windows login:** Starts automatically
6. **Forever:** Runs silently in background

### Verify It's Working

**Check Task Manager:**
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+Esc`
- Look for process: `pythonw.exe`
- Command line contains: `autonomous_librarian.py`

**Check the Log:**
```
C:\Projects\AI-Librarian\orchestrator\orchestrator.log
```

Should show:
```

## 🎯 Troubleshooting

### "I installed it, is it working?"

**Yes if:**
- ✅ `pythonw.exe` in Task Manager
- ✅ `orchestrator.log` has recent entries
- ✅ New files appear in `logger\raw_logs\`
- ✅ Database updates in `curator\processed\conversations.db`

### "Nothing seems to be happening"

**Try this:**
1. Double-click `orchestrator\start_manual.bat`
2. Watch console output for errors
3. Check if Claude Desktop is running
4. Verify Windows UI Automation is enabled

### "Want to see it working"

**Real-time monitoring:**
1. Open `orchestrator\orchestrator.log` in Notepad
2. Keep refreshing to see new entries
3. Watch `logger\raw_logs\` folder for new files
4. Check Task Manager → pythonw.exe → CPU usage (should be low)

### "How do I know it's capturing?"

**Open Claude Desktop and have a conversation, then:**
1. Wait 1 minute
2. Check `logger\raw_logs\` for new `.jsonl` file
3. File size should be growing
4. `orchestrator.log` will show compression activity after 5 minutes

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: First Time Setup
Run `start_manual.bat` first time to watch it work, then install autonomous mode.

### Tip 2: Monitor Performance
Check `orchestrator.log` once a week to see stats:
```
[2025-11-15 14:30:00] 📊 Status: Logger=True, Raw=1, Compressed=3, Last compression=14:25:00
```

### Tip 3: Save Space
After autonomous mode runs for a week, raw logs in `logger\raw_logs\` can be deleted (they're already compressed in `compressor\compressed\`). Saves 85% disk space!

### Tip 4: Backup Your Database
Periodically copy:
```
curator\processed\conversations.db
```
to a backup location. This is your entire conversation history!

### Tip 5: Search Often
Get in the habit of searching your past conversations:
```bash
python curator\claude_curator.py search "that thing we discussed"
```

You'll be amazed how often you need to reference past conversations!
